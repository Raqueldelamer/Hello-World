# Hello-World

<h2>Bearer Token</h2>
<br>

I noticed that you have to be very careful with this process and where you store the token as it can break or stop working if not set correctly before generating it. The bearer token was tricky to get. Unfortunately I didn’t take screen shots of the process because I was in a breakout room getting verbal instructions from Robert. The token is one time view from the GitHub website. Had I not saved it and sent it to myself in an email, I would’ve lost it because they don’t send emails with they token like other api sites do. Also, another tricky thing about it is that I refreshed the page and lost my 201 Created access to the page. That I did thankfully take a screenshot of which is below. 
When attempting to redo the Post user/repos I received a 422 Unprocessable Error code. :(
